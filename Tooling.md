#Tooling 

What is a test tool and the purpose of tooling 

**A software product that supports one or more test activities** 

##Benefits 

* Amount of time performing mundane and repetitive task is reduced 
* Allows manual testers time for more challenging and complex testing tasks 
* Provide more consistent and reliable results for repetitive task 
* Reports or findings 

##Risks 

* Sometimes we can think a tool solves everything 
* Need to implement and maintain tool 
* Difficulty in implementing and maintaining the tool 
* Not being able to understand the tool to obtain the benefits required 

##Introducing a tool 

* Analyse problem at hand 
* Consider constraints and requirements of the tool 
* Evaluate tools and create a shortlist 
* Run pilot project 
* Conduct periodic lessons learnt and reviews 
* Provide a proof of concept - explaining why you need to tool to stakeholders and managers 

##Successful Implementation of a Tool 

* Implementing findings from a pilot - high level process changes or workarounds 
* Writing clear user guidelines and instructions based on pilot project recommendations 
* Rolling out the incrementally to ensure positive response from the new users and clear understanding 
* Training, coaching and mentoring usage of the tool 
* Monitoring usage of the tool 
* Meeting budget

##Types of Tools
* **Test Management Tools**- provide support for various activities and task throughout development life cycle. Can interface with other tools 
* **Incident Management Tools** - provide the creation of an incident report and maintenance of details about the incident as it progresses 
* **Requirements Management Tool** - *Used by BAs* to record, manage and prioritise system requirements 
* **Configuration management Tools** - Used to manage the versions of different software and hardware components. 
* **Review Tools** - Provide framework for review and inspections
	* maintaining information 
	* ability to record, communicate and retain review comments and defects
	* amend and reissue deliverables 
*	**Static analysis Tools** - Analyse code before it is executed to identify defects as early as possible *Used by Developers*
* Modelling Tools - Used by developers during *analysis and design stage*
	* cost effective at finding defects early
* **Test Design Tools** -  support creations of test cases 
* **Test Comparators Tools** - compare contents of files. Highlights difference and this provide assistance to *developers* when localising and debugging code
* **Security Test Tools** - used to test functions the detect security threats and to evaluate the security characteristics of software 
	* Assess the ability of software under test
* **Dynamic Testing Tools** - *Used by developers* to find defects that are difficult to find during static testing. used during *Component testing *
