#Static Testing - Page 60

Dynamic Testing 

* Examination of the coed through execution of the software 

Static Testing

* Examination of software and work-products without the code being executed 

###What can be reviewed ?

* Code 
* Requirements 
* Business Policy 
* Strategy
* Test Plans/ Design/ Cases

Helps to identify defects before they are part of executable code 

##Benefits 

* Correction of defects in early work 
* Reduces testing times and costs
* Fewer defect in the final software reduces lifetime cost 
* Communication is improved as the team discusses ambiguous content and makes sure there is a clear understanding 

#Review and levels of formality
![Review and levels of formality](http://www.softwaretestinggenius.com/photos/ISBF30.JPG)
 
 * Informal 
 	* not necessarily documented  
 * Walkthrough 
 	* relatively informal 
 	* **led by author of the document** 
 	* main purpose to enable learning 
 * Technical review 
	* documented 
	* **reviewed by trained moderator**
 * Inspection 
 	* **led by trained moderator**
 	* very formal 
 	* pre meeting preparation is essential 
 	* main purpose to find defects

##Typical Defects 

* Deviation form internal or regulatory standards 
* Requirements defects 
* Design defects 
* Insufficient maintainability 
* Incorrect interface specification s 
* Causes rather than faults are found 
* dead code 
* syntax violations 
* programming standards variations 

#Formal Review Activities  

* **Planning** 
	* Defining the review criteria 
	* Selecting the personnel
	* Allocating Roles
	* Defining the entry and exit criteria 
	* Selecting documents to be reviewed
* **Kick Off (Starting Off)**
	* Distributing documents 
	* explaining the objectives  
* **Individual Preparation**
	* Preparing for the review meeting by reviewing the documents
	* noting potential defects
* **Examination, evaluation, recording of results**
	* Discussing or logging, with documented results or minutes
	* noting defects, making recommendations regarding handing the defects
	* re-examining, evaluating and recording defects 
* **Rework**
	* fixing defects found 
	* recording updated status of defects 
* **Follow Up**
	*   checking that defect have been addressed 
	*   gathering metrics 

#Roles in a Formal Review

* **Leader/Moderator** 
	* Plans review, chooses participants, conducts meetings 
* **Manager**
	* decides on the execution of reviews. Determine whether review process objectives 
* **Author**
	* of the documentation being reviewed  
* **Reviewers/Inspectors**
	* specialised fault find roles 
* **Scribe**
	* documents all the issues and points made during the meeting 
* **Other**
	* inspection/review co-ordinator  

##Success Factors 

* Each review has clear predefined objectives 
* Testers are valued reviewers who contribute to the review and also learn about the product which enables them to prepare tests 
* Defects found are welcomed and expressed objectively
* The review is conducted in an atmosphere of trust

##Static Analysis 

* Carried out once code has been written to find defects in software source code and software model 
* Early detection of defect before test execution
* Identifies defects not easily in dynamic testing development standard breaches and dependencies or inconsistencies
