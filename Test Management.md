#Test Management

##Risk - ISTQB

Could be a threat, situation, event or hazard 

* Product 
	* Potential failure areas in software that are a risk to the quality of the software 
	* The potential of defect occurring in a live environment is a product risk   
* Project Risk 
	* Factor relating to the way the work is carried out 
	* issues which will adversely affect the capability of a project team to deliver their work  

##Product Risk 

* Failure prone software 
* potential the software/hardware could cause harm 
* poor software characteristics security 
* poor integrity and quality
* software the does not perform intended functions 

##Project Risk 

* failure of third party 
* skills training 
* personal issues 
* political issues 
* improper attitude

##Risk based testing - Page 144
Based testing around parts of the project that are of highest risk 

#Organisation 

##Project Roles
* Project managers 
* QA managers 
* Developers 
* Business and domain experts 

#Test Manager/Leader

* Test strategy - mitigate risk 
* Plan and negotiate with project managers and other stakeholder 
* Time effort and cost 
* Quality of the work product and the quality of the testing 
* Ensures the appropriate training has taken place 
* Make sure the appropriate environments are in place 
* Report - progress vs actual 
* Training 

#Tester

 * review and contribute to test plan 
 * writing test cases 
 * prepare test data 
 * executing test 
 * automate tests 
 * using tools 

 
#Independence - Page 145

Separation of responsibilities, which encourages the accomplishment of objective testing.

##Benefits of Independent Testing 

* See defects that others who are closer to the project may not 
* The test is unbiased 
* Can verify assumptions made during the specification and implementation phases
* Can verify assumptions regarding the quality of the software 

##Drawbacks 

* Can be seen as separated from the project 
* Can be easily blamed for delays and targeted as delivery bottlenecks 
* Developer may no longer feel responsible for their mistakes 
* Fully independent testers may find communication with development team difficult 

#Test Planning & Estimation 

* scope 
* what to test 
* scheduling  

##Entry Criteria - Page 156

Determine when a given test activity can start

* test environment is available for use 
* test tolls are installling the environment 
* testing code is available 
* all test data is available 
* high risk areas have been fully tested 
* schedule and budget has been met 

#Estimation - Page 158

* Metics-Based 
	* relies on data from previous projects
* Expert-Based 
	* estimation are based on experience.
	* Could be from developers, analysts, SME, test consultants.

#Test Progress Monitoring and Control - Page 159

* based on the activities and timescales within the test plan 
* constantly review actual against planned 

##Common Metics 
* percentage of work done 
* number of test cases executed 
* defect total and details 
* subjective confidence of release 
* milestones achieved 
* test coverage of requirements, risk or code 
* subjective confidence of testers in the product

#Test reporting 

Communicating our findings to other project stakeholders

#Test Control 
Monitoring the progress of the project

* re-prioritising test 
* change the test schedule 
* review product risk 
* adjust the scope

#Configuration Management - Page 168

Process of managing products, facilities and processes by managing the information about them, including changes, and ensuring they are what they are supposed to be in every case 

keeping track of changes in software, hardware and documentation 

* configuration identification 
* control 
* status accounting - current state of document 
* auditing 

###If you don't have good config management 

* multi people working on the same element at the same time 
* not able to match program source to object code 

#Incident Management - Page 165 

**Process of recognising, investigating, taking action and disposing of incidents** 

An unplanned event within testing.

* Logging incidents 
* classifying them 
* identifying the impact 
* tracking
