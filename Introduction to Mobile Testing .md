#Introduction to Mobile Technologies 

What is Mobile 

* Smaller screens than laptops 
* Cellular network (3G/4G)
* Touch screen interfaces 

##Considerations 
* Screen size
* different screen, resolution input methods, browsers 
* access to hardware (camera/mic/geo etc)
* network speed (edge vs 4g vs wifi)
* offline working (appcache, local storage)
* different hardware capabilities - cpu, memory, disk space 
* different apps using device hardware simultaneously (interportability)

##Web Vs Native
* Native 
	* more feature rich 
	* better performing 
	* better access to device features 
	* faster - they fully utilize hard ware 
	* better offline support - access to device native storage and no reliance of online services 
	* better for action-focused products - better for applications that do things rather then presenting information 
* Web based 
	* depends on the server 
	* cheaper to implement 
	* cheaper to maintain 
	* better cross-platform/device support 
	* more discoverable 
	* better for content-focused 
* Hybrid
	* Facebook, both installed and relies on server
	* executable files can be downloaded 
	* combination of native and web 
	* interface of the native app merges with the ease and content of the web app
	* installation, upgrades, uninstall required

##Application Architecture
* Thin Client 
* Fat Client 

##Connection Types 
Server Connection 
 
* Wi Fi 
* 2G
* 3G
* 4G
* Bluetooth 

##Push and Pull Connection
Pull - when the client ask the sever for information 
Push - when the serve sends information to client (text message)

##Store & Forward 
Relating to or denoting a data network in which messages are routed to one or more intermediate stations where they may be stored before being forwarded to their destinations.
