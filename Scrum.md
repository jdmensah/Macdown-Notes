> A team-based framework to develop complex systems and products

An Iterative Process

Product backlog - prioritised list of user stories 
sprint backlog   
sprint   
shippable product 

Sprints are incremental releases of product software. within a sprint you have a sprint backlog, which is a list of user stories taken from the product backlog that you wish to work on within the sprint.

##Scrum roles 
**Product owner** 

- represent the business and the customer
- own the product backlog
- write the user stories 
- starts to write acceptance criteria 
- prioritize stories 
- steers the products development
- owns the product vision 
- responsible for defining the features needed in the product 

**Team Member**

- deliver the stories 
- owns the estimation process 
- decides how to do the work 
- avoids "its not my job" mentality 
- jointly accountable for the work 
- usually 7 +/-2 in a scrum team 
- does all the dev and the testing
- made up of dev, UX/UI, QA (testers)  

**Scrum Master** 

- expert and advisor of the scrum 
- coach
- impediment bulldozer
- facilitator 
- steers the team's process
- running the meeting
- keeping things going and on track

##SCRUM Artifacts
**User Stories**

 - a way of describe the feature set 
 - follows as a ..... i need.... so that....
 
**Product backlog**

 - prioritized listed of features known as user stories which could go into the product  

**Sprint backlog**

 - highest priority user stories that we commit to work on during the current sprint 

**Task board** 

-	contains task associated with the project. ie sprint backlog, accepted, done

**Burn down Chart**

- remaining work vs time
- a form of reporting 
- show the progress of a sprint, on the completion of tasks in the sprint backlog  

**Definition of Done**

- checklist of quality 
- something that every user story must also meet this checklist 

##Agile Ceremonies 
* Release planning 
	* prioritised backlog - what things need be achieved 
	* who's on the team 
	* what's tools are we going to use
	* environments - do we have stable environments 
	* budget
	* timings - we need to think how are we going to divide are time to 	met the deadline
* sprint planning
	* Product owner presents prioritized stories 
	* Split large (epic) stories
	* throw out stories that are not needed
	* discuss acceptance criteria 
	* discuss approach 
	* add acceptance criteria
	* estimate stories
	* commit to the stories 
	* discuss the implementation in details 
	* split the stories into task 
	* adjust the commitment if needed 
	* agree the sprint 
* daily standup (SCRUM)
	* daily 
	* synchronize team 
	* only the team are present 
	* brief 
	* pointed - to the point, not waffle, key things the team need to 	know
	* what they have completed, what are they going to work on and what will block them from working 
* sprint review (demo) 
	* demo the work done 
	* no powerpoint - working software 
	* anyone can attend 
	* a chance to demonstrate the teams achievements 
	* gather feedback from stakeholders 
	* get sign off on what's been done 
	* provide recommendations to stakeholders 
	* a chance to showcase the work done 
	* delivered by the whole team 
* sprint retrospective 
	* discuss the process 
	* work out what went well 
	* what didn't go so well 
	* what could be improved

we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available and the situation at hand

#Product Backlog and Estimation 

##Story points 
* an estimation tool in agile projects 
* used to gauge the complexity of user stories 

##Planning poker 
* encourages all team members to contribute to estimation 
* involves the entire team 0 the people actually carrying out the work 
* uses the wisdom of the crowd 
* brings multiple diverse opinions together 
* numbers on the cards are based on the fibonacci sequence 

#Sprint Zero 
you discover what you are working on, set calendar event - when are sprint demos 

#Velocity 

actual velocity vs projected velocity 

Velocity is a metric that predicts how much work an Agile software development team can successfully complete from sprint to sprint. 

Velocity is a useful planning tool for estimating how fast work can be completed and how long it will take to complete a project.

##Sustainable Pace

[Sustainable Pace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVmZY42r8oc&index=15)

Ensures agile teams have time to plan, think rest and deliver effectively 
The team cannot continue to work at a high pace, they will burn out and this can reduce the quality of work they produce

De scope to allow the team to manage the tasks set 

a sustainable pace is reflected in the velocity of the group 

##Burn Up Chart
[Burn Up Charts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK_CJBsqITQ)

* measure and communicate the progress of the project
* highlight risk 
* provide a reliable basis for decision making and course direction 
* plot scope of release 
* it is a metric representing things in a simple way 
* shows progress against the release plan 
*
