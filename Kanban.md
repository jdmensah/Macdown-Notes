#Kanban - Visual Card

##Origins

[Kanban Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban)
 
> Kanban is a popular framework used by software teams practicing agile software development. It is enormously prominent among today's agile software teams, but the kanban methodology of work dates back more than 50 years.

> In the late 1940s Toyota began optimizing its engineering processes based on the same model that supermarkets were using to stock their shelves. Supermarkets stock just enough product to meet consumer demand, a practice that optimizes the flow between the supermarket and the consumer. Because inventory levels match consumption patterns, the supermarket gains significant efficiency in inventory management by decreasing the amount of excess stock it must hold at any given team. Meanwhile, the supermarket can still ensure that the given product a consumer needs is always in stock.

> When Toyota applied this same system to its factory floors, the goal was to better align their massive inventory levels with the actual consumption of materials. To communicate capacity levels in real-time on the factory floor (and to suppliers), workers would pass a card, or "kanban", between teams. When a bin of materials being used on the production line was emptied, a kanban was passed to the warehouse describing what material was needed, the exact amount of this material, and so on. The warehouse would have a new bin of this material waiting, which they would then send to the factory floor, and in turn send their own kanban to the supplier. The supplier would also have a bin of this particular material waiting, which it would ship to the warehouse. While the signaling technology of this process has evolved since the 1940s, this same "just in time" (or JIT) manufacturing process is still at the heart of it.

##Benefits 

* Flexible planning options
* Faster output
* Clearer focus
* Transparency throughout the development cycle.
* Planning flexibility
* Shortened cycle timesre
* Fewer bottlenecks
* Visual metrics
* Continuous delivery

##Principles of Kanban

* Start with the testing software development processes 
* agreement to pursue incremental and evolutionary changes
* a respect and evolution  of the current processes roles and responsibilities 

##Kanban Process

* Visualises data flow to identify bottlenecks
* Sets work in progress (WIP) limits to focus on the current task 
* Concentrate effort on a single task at any given time to enhance efficiency
* product owner will keep that backlog update similar to scrum 

##Continuous Flow

* Workflows should be monitored 
* measurements of flow are used to identify core improvements in the process
* promotes a shared understanding of the system 
* introduces the ability to monitor whether changes to the process have produced positive or negative effects 

##Limit WIP 

* Apply limits to the work in progress at each stage of the development process 
* work is pulled into the nest phase of development once it is ready 
* increase in quality of task completion die to a focus on singular tasks 
* can reduce lead time by easing competing concerns for task beyond developers role
* Focus on the important tasks first one by once - ticks off the singular most important tasks  

##Scrum vs. kanban

Kanban and scrum share some of the same concepts but have very different approaches. They should not be confused with one another

###Businesses 

* Just in time (JIT) is an inventory management system, used to manage the stock that is kept in storage. It involves receiving goods from suppliers as and when they are required, rather than carrying a large inventory at once.

####Advantages 
* Less space needed
* Waste reduction
* Smaller investments

####Disadvantages 
* Risk of running out of stock
* Lack of control over time frame
* More planning required

####Contradictions 
* Atlassian says its causes fewer bottleneck where as 
* Bottlenecks. To address bottlenecks in the system, it makes more sense to suspend the Kanban production schedule and focus on fixing the bottleneck. The situation is similar to what happens with a traffic accident occurs at an intersection where the assistance of a police officer, the planning scheduler, is needed to manage the traffic until the bottleneck is cleared.

###WIP

* A WIP (work in progress) limit is a strategy for preventing bottlenecks in software development.  

* Work in progress limits are agreed upon by the development team before a project begins and are enforced by the team's facilitator. For example, a team may divide the tasks that must be performed for a feature into design, code, test and deploy.  When a WIP limit for a certain task has been reached, the team stops and works together to clear the bottleneck.  The goal of working in this manner is meant to ensure that the entire team takes ownership of the project and produces high quality code.
