##HTML 5
`<header>` - contains the title of the document  
`<main>` - you can have the body in the main  
`<body>` - born before HTML 5   
`<section>` -  
`<aside>` - if you have a section in a html document, if you need to add extra bits ot the document you use aside. Whatever is in the side should be related to the information in the main tag, but if taken away it shouldnt lessen the information in the main. 

For example having your horoscope to your cv you would add it to `<aside>` if information but not essential 

`<article>` - a way for writing articles  
`<footer>` - add information about the document, such as copyright
