#Mobile Testing 

##Types of Mobile Testing 
> Consider these for testing project

* Performance - Non Functional Req
* Operational 
* Memory 
* Interrupt 
* Functional
* Installations
* Security 
* Usability

#Tours
> Mobile Tour - Help us with are test approach, give us structure for the work that we are doing 

* creating a logical exploration of a product 
* helps understand how apps work

##FCC CUTS VIDS 

Feature tour  
Complexity tour  
Claims tour  

Configuration tour  
User tour  
Testability tour  
Scenario tour  

Variability tour  
Interopeability tour  
Data tour  
Structure tour  

* Feature tour: Move through the application and get familiar with all the controls and features you come across.

* Complexity tour: Find the five most complex things about the application.

* Claims tour: Find all the information in the product that tells you what the product does.

* Configuration tour: Attempt to find all the ways you can change settings in the product in a way that the application retains those settings.

* User tour: Imagine five users for the product and the information they would want from the product or the major features they would be interested in.

* Testability tour: Find all the features you can use as testability features and/or identify tools you have available that you can use to help in your testing.

* Scenario tour: Imagine five realistic scenarios for how the users identified in the user tour would use this product.

* Variability tour: Look for things you can change in the application - and then you try to change them.

* Interopeability tour: What does this application interact with?

* Data tour: Identify the major data elements of the application.

* Structure tour: Find everything you can about what comprises the physical product (code, interfaces, hardware, files, etc...).

##I SLICED UP FUN 
* Inputs Into The Device

* Store
* Location
* Interactions/Interruptions
* Communication
* Ergonomics
* Data

* Usability
* Platform

* Function 
* User Scenarios
* Network

##Mobile Specific Tours 
* Gestures
* Orientation 
* change your mind 
* motion 
* location 

##Fundamental Test Process applied to mobile App Testing 
* Identify scope & objectives 
* Priority & schedule 
	* what is in the queue 
	* how is it be tested 
	* how long will it take to test 
	* what is the current status 
	* what is the priority  
* Test execution & delivery (*refer to mind app*)
	* Testing for device 
	* input 
	* compliance 
	* os
	* functionality 
	* compatibility 
	* interrupt 
	* database
	* reliability 
	* security   	 
* Analysis and reporting 
	* Defect volume 
	* defect severity 
	* defect distribution 
	* quality history 
	* current quality status 
* Certify app/device 
	* Are we able to release the app
