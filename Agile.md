#Agile Overview 

* individuals and interactions *over* processes and tools 
* working software *over* comprehensive  documentation 
* customer collaboration *over* contract negotiation 
* responding to change *over* following a path 

##Agile Principles 
[12 Principles](http://blog.hubspot.com/agency/basic-principles-agile-project-management#sm.0000108mei6zn0d4ysas3qd73yppy) 

have you applied it 
how is it usual in the tech world 
where have you used it before 
where could you have used it 

7. working software is the primary measure of progress 
8. agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely 
	* When working on the same project for a VERY long time, burnout can be a common problem among agile teams. To prevent this, work should be done in short productive bursts because excessive overtime cannot continue indefinitely without impacting the quality. Focus on choosing the right pace for the team members. Usually, the best pace is one that allows team members to leave the office tired yet satisfied. 
	* 
9. continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility 

##Advantages of Agile ?

* leads to better quality software
* customer satisfaction
* regular delivery of working software 
* happier team  members 
* focus on technical excellence 

--

* requirements in agile are called user story
	- who, what, why structure 
* product backlog 
 	- things that need to be built to make the products 
* sprint backlog 
	- defines the scope of sprint  
	- taken from the product backlog 
* scrum master 
	- removes obstacles 
	- records progress in sprint back log 
	- facilitate meeting 
	- guide the process 
	- someone knows the scrum inside and out  
* scrum team 
	- 
* product owner - owns the vision of the product 
	- 
* end of sprint review 
	- shows product to stakeholder 
* sprint retrospective 
	- what worked well, what didn't, what can be changed. 
	- This is at the end of the sprint 
* sprints are also called iterations
* at the end of every sprint a product is delivered 

benefits   
time-to-merit - product out quickly 
user is certain of what they are getting 
increase revenue by focusing on customer value 

##Key Points 

* break big problem or work items into smaller chunks 
* focus on the most important business needs
* ensure what you deliver works 
* actively seek feedback 
* change course where necessary 
* be accountable as a team 

##Team Accountability 

##Agile Planning 

##Agile Teams

* co-located
* engaged customers
* self-organizing
* accountable & empowered
* cross functional 

##Agile Roles
* Dev
* PM
* QA
* BA
* UX

**Customer/Product Owner**

* Owns the vision of the product 
* speaking to the customers to see what they want and making the requirements to feed back to the scrum master 
* prioritising the requirements and the way things will get done 
* keeping expectations - what is possible 
* talking to the customer and writing user story

**Business Analyst**

* like a middle man between tech team and product owner 
* translating the requirements to the tech team 
* they may have knowledge of code
* helping the product owner to write good use story
* what we need the user story to do, a checklist sort of - acceptance criteria 

**Developer**

* writes the code 

**Project Manager**

* manages and direct the project 
* selfless, making things easy for the team, empower the team, give the team responsibility 

**Agile Tester**

* test software for bugs and defects 

**Designer/UX**

#User Stories 

User stories are agile requirements  
who, what, why

* understandable (by normal people)
* follow As a.... I want... So that...
* **I**ndependent - no dependancies, 
* **N**egotiable - able to get something that everyone is comfortable with
* **V**aluable - has to have business value, addressing the correct point
* **E**stimable - 
* **S**mall - simple enough so that we can get it done within the timeframe 
* **T**estable - is a user story that we can actually carry out, we need it to be pointed and specific 

[INVEST](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/invest/)

"I" ndependent (of all others)  
"N" egotiable (not a specific contract for features)  
"V" aluable (or vertical)  
"E" stimable (to a good approximation)  
"S" mall (so as to fit within an iteration)  
"T" estable (in principle, even if there isn't a test for it yet)

user is sent confirmations of regsiter 
user clicks on link in email and is taken to successful log in page 
store details of user even if they havent confirmed in eamil
